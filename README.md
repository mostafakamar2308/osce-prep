# Med Simulate

Platform for helping medical students to train for how to be a good doctor and do clinical reasoning.

## Purpose

In egypt, as an intern it will be the first time you'd manage a case. The only method to be ready is to read books and apply on patients directly. This causes:

- Fear and anxiety as it's the first time.
- Mistakes and may cause harm to patients.

  So I created MedSimulate to help people practice for the real deal:

- Talk to patients.
- Order investigations.
- Do Physical Examinations.
- Diagnose the patient.
- Issue the management protocol for the patient.

Also you'd get _Real Feedback_ based on your progress to know what you missed and what you can improve.
